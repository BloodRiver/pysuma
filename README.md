### Python Super Market V1.3:
- See settings.json for admin username and password
- Register and store account details in database
- Login as customer and place order
- Login as admin and add/remove accounts, items, assign/remove adminship
- View orders and confirm when payment received (not really this is just something I made to learn more about python.)
