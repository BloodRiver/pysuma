### Python Super Market Version 0:

This is the first ever console-based application that I made while I was learning python programming back in 2017.

This program does the following:

- Admin username and password are at the beginning of the code.
- Uses python dictionaries as database for items.
- Login as admin to modify item data in database (requires password to login)
- Login as customer and place order (does not require password to login)


Problem with this application is that it is not for the average user. It needs to be further simplified so that users can easily understand and work with this application.

Thank you for downoading and checking out my python console application. Please do inform me about any errors or bugs or what I can add to this application.
This application will remain for educational purposes only. You will not have to pay me any money to check this thing out.
