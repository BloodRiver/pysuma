### Python Super Market V1.3:

Python Super Market. A useless software but my pride and joy as I made one for the first time ever. I started learning Python in January 2017. Within 6 months, I became quite dexterous in the language and was able to make CLI applications while doing my best to make sure the code wouldn't ever be buggy or crash.
After that, I shifted my focus to building GUIs and made my first ever GUI application. It's pretty basic but it works along with a database system which allows the program to retain the changes in data without losing data when the application is closed, or the computer is turned off.
For now, it only works on Windows and Linux Devices. I hope to be able to improve it and make a mobile app version of it too someday.


- See settings.json for admin username and password
- Register and store account details in database
- Login as customer and place order
- Login as admin and add/remove accounts, items, assign/remove adminship
- View orders and confirm when payment received (not really this is just something I made to learn more about python.)


Thank you for downoading and checking out my python GUI application. Please do inform me about any errors or bugs or what I can add to this application.
This application will remain for educational purposes only. You will not have to pay me any money to check this thing out.
